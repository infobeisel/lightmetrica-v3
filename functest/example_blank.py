#
# Rendering blank image
# ==========================
#
# Let's start to use Lightmetrica by rendering a blank image.
# We first import the ``lightmetrica`` module, where we use ``lm`` as an alias of ``lightmetrica`` for simplicity.
#
# .. note::
#     Although we recommend to use Python API to organize the experiments, similar APIs can be accessible from C++. See `example directory`_ for the detail.
#
#     .. _example directory: https://github.com/hi2p-perim/lightmetrica-v3/tree/master/example
#
# .. note::
#     ``lmenv`` is a simple module to configure Lightmetrica envrionment from a specified file. Here we load ``.lmenv``. You want to create your own ``.lmenv`` file if you want to execute examples or tests by yourself. For detail, please refer to :ref:`executing_functional_tests`.
# -

import lmenv
lmenv.load('.lmenv')

import lightmetrica as lm

# + {"nbsphinx": "hidden"}
if not lm.Release:
    lm.debug.attach_to_debugger()

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# Lightmetrica offers an extension for the Jupyter notebook to support logging or interactive progress reporting inside the notebook. The extension can be loaded by a line magic command as below.
# -

# %load_ext lightmetrica_jupyter

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# After importing the module, you can initialize the framwork by calling :cpp:func:`lm::init` function. You can pass various arguments to configure the framework to the function, but here we keep it empty so that everything is configured to be default.
# -

lm.init()

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# Logging and progress reporting in Jupyter notebook can be enabled by :cpp:func:`lm::log::init` and :cpp:func:`lm::progress::init` functions with corresponding types.
# -

lm.log.init('jupyter')
lm.progress.init('jupyter')

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# Once the framework has been initialized properly, you can get an splash message using :cpp:func:`lm::info()` function.
# -

lm.info()

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# Next we define `assets` necessary to execute renderer, like materials, meshes, etc. In this example, we only need a `film` to which the renderer outputs the image. We can define assets by ``lm::load_*`` function, where ``*`` represents the name of the asset. In this example, we want to make ``film`` asset. So we use :cpp:func:`lm::load_film` function.
#
# The first argument (``film``) specifies id of the asset to be referenced. The second argument (``bitmap``) is given as the type of the assets.
# The last argument (``{...}``) specifies the parameters passed to the instance.
#
# For convenicence, we will refer to the asset of the specific type in ``<asset type>::<name>`` format. For instance, ``film::bitmap`` represents a `bitmap film` asset.  ``film::bitmap`` takes two parameters ``w`` and ``h`` which respectively specify width and height of the film.
#
# This function returns a reference to the asset. You can access the underlying member functions. You can find details in :ref:`api_ref`.
# -

film = lm.load_film('film', 'bitmap', {
    'w': 1920,
    'h': 1080
})

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# The created instance of the asset is internally managed by the framework.
# Lightmetrica uses `component locator` to access the instance.
#
# A component locator is a string starting with the character ``$`` and the words connected by ``.``. A locator indicates a location of the instance managed by the framework. For instance, the locator of the ``film`` asset is ``$.assets.film``. This can be queried by ``.loc()`` function.
# -

film.loc()

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# To rendering an image, we need to create `renderer` asset. Here, we will create ``renderer::blank`` renderer.  ``renderer::blank`` is a toy renderer that only produces a blank image to the film. The renderer takes ``film`` parameter to specify the film to output the image, and ``color`` parameter for the background color.
#
# A reference to the other asset as a parameter can be passed using component locator. Here we use ``film.loc()`` to get a locator of the film.
# -

renderer = lm.load_renderer('renderer', 'blank', {
    'output': film.loc(),
    'color': [1,1,1]
})

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# :cpp:func:`lm::Renderer::render` function executes rendering.
# -

renderer.render()

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# After rendering, the generated image is kept in ``film``. :cpp:func:`lm::Film::save` function outputs this film to the disk as an image.
# -

film.save('blank.png')

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# You can also visualize the film directly in Jupyter notebook. :cpp:func:`lm::Film::buffer` gets the internal image data as numpy array which you can visualize using matplotlib. We rendered a white blank image thus the following image is as we expected.
# -

import numpy as np
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

img = np.copy(film.buffer())
f = plt.figure(figsize=(15,15))
ax = f.add_subplot(111)
ax.imshow(np.clip(np.power(img,1/2.2),0,1), origin='lower')
plt.show()

# + {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext", "active": ""}
# Finally, we gracefully shutdown the framework with :cpp:func:`lm::shutdown` function. Usually you don't want to explicitly call shutdown function.
# -

lm.shutdown()
